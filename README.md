Welcome to the source code of `kinobot`. This code is provided with the purpose of being reused or modified in other projects or analyzed for better understanding. Currently, the development and production environment for this application is complex and difficult to reproduce. As a result, this code may be useful as a reference or starting point for your own development projects, but it may not be suitable for production use without further modification or testing.

Note that this project is currently being rewritten with a new codebase and additional features. During the rewrite, I have made some changes to the design concepts used in this original source code. As a result, some of the approaches and techniques used in this code may not be reflected in the new version of the application. However, also note that changes are still being made to this repository as development continues.
